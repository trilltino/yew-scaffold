Yew Template for Soroban dApps
A Yew SPA wired directly to Soroban smart contracts
Built with Rust, compiled to WebAssembly
Freighter wallet integration
Soroban Contract Frontend 

This template is a stepping stone to building an entire decentralized apps in Rust

What Next?

Axum as backend
fast , async-native, and composable  handles API routes, auth, and contract indexing
Shared types: Define your domain types in a shared crate. Yew, Axum, and Soroban all use the same Rust structs - removes JSON parsing errors that occur in JS backends.

Thinking Forward

Yew + Axum + Soroban is is a path to a full-stack Rust ecosystem where: You donâ€™t switch between Rust and JavaScript.
You write once, reuse everywhere.
You get the speed and safety guarantees of Rust across all layers.
Opening the ecosystem to  full-stack Rust developers who can build , secure, scalable, production-grade dApps.

Similarity to Scaffold Stellar

This project plays a role for Yew that Scaffold Stellar does for React/Next.js:
Scaffold Stellar provides a React-based starter with contract integration and wallet support.
This Yew template provides the same foundation, but for a Rust-only frontend workflow.
Both aim to reduce boilerplate, accelerate prototyping, and standardize dApp structure.
Where Scaffold Stellar helps JS developers onboard to Soroban, this template helps Rust developers stay in their ecosystem without switching stacks.
